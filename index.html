               <br>
               <h3>Camp Lejeune Water Contamination</h3>
               <br>
               For over 30 years, service members, their families, and other civilians living and working at Camp Lejeune were potentially exposed to contaminated drinking water. Camp Lejeune is the largest Marine Corps base on the East Coast, located in Jacksonville, North Carolina. Between 1953 and 1987, Marines and civilians drank, cooked with, and bathed in water found to be contaminated. Toxic chemicals, including four specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were identified in the water.
               <br>
               All four VOCs have been linked to serious, and sometimes deadly, illnesses such as various cancers, leukemia, and Parkinson’s disease.
               <br>
               <br>
               <h3>Findings</h3>
               <br>
               The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, which is part of the Centers for Disease Control, linked the contamination with industrial spills, leaking underground storage tanks, and most prominently, an off-base dry cleaning company. The main contaminants in the Camp Lejeune water supply were trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), benzene, and vinyl chloride. Exposure to just one of these chemicals over time is enough to cause damage to the human body. For instance, TCE is carcinogenic to humans through all routes of exposure. It can also cause non-cancerous damage in the central nervous system, kidney, liver, immune system, male reproductive system, and to a developing embryo or fetus. These findings are supported by evidence spanning several decades.             
               <br>
               <br>
               <h3>Camp Lejeune Justice Act</h3>
               <br>
               To aid victims of long-term use of the base's contaminated water, the federal government passed the Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act (PACT Act). This became federal law once President Biden signed off on the Camp Lejeune Justice Act CLJA) on August 10, 2022. The act grants the U.S. District Court of North Carolina exclusive jurisdiction to hear these cases. A potential plaintiff has two years after the CLJA's enactment to file a suit. Prior to filing, however, they must first submit an administrative claim with the Department of the Navy. The claim must set forth certain key facts such as the dates of exposure and medical diagnosis of any health condition, medical treatment information, and any other financial or mental impact suffered by the plaintiff. Damages awarded to a plaintiff will be offset by any previously paid disability claims.

          <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
            Yes.  The number of employees an employer has does not affect whether it is an Eligible Employer that may claim the credit.

            Yes, organizations described in section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), and exempt from tax under section 501(a) of the Code, may be Eligible Employers for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit if they are employers that otherwise meet the requirements to be eligible for the credit.

        <div class="accordion-item-body">
          <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
            Orders, proclamations, or decrees from the Federal government, or any State or local government are considered "orders from an appropriate governmental authority" if they limit commerce, travel, or group meetings due to COVID-19 in a manner that affects an employer's operation of its trade or business, including orders that limit hours of operation and, if they are from a State or local government, they are from a State or local government that has jurisdiction over the employer's operations (referred to as a "governmental order").

          5. What is a "significant decline in gross receipts"?

        <div class="accordion-item-body">
          <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
            A significant decline in gross receipts begins with the first calendar quarter in 2020 in which an employer’s gross receipts are less than 50 percent of its gross receipts for the same calendar quarter in 2019.  The significant decline in gross receipts ends with the first calendar quarter that follows the first calendar quarter in which the employer’s 2020 quarterly gross receipts are greater than 80 percent of its gross receipts for the same calendar quarter in 2019, or with the first calendar quarter of 2021.

          8. If a governmental order causes the suppliers to an essential business to suspend their operations, is the essential business considered to have a suspension of operations?
     </div>
        <div class="accordion-item-body">
          <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
            An employer with an essential business may be considered to have a full or partial suspension of operations if the business's suppliers are unable to make deliveries of critical goods or materials due to a governmental order that causes the supplier to suspend its operations. If the facts and circumstances indicate that the essential business's operations are fully or partially suspended as a result of the inability to obtain critical goods or materials from its suppliers that were required to suspend operations, then the essential business would be considered an Eligible Employer and may be eligible to receive the Employee Retention Credit.

        <div class="accordion-item-header">
          9. If a governmental order requires an employer to close its workplace for certain purposes, but the workplace may remain operational for limited purposes, is the employer considered to have a suspension of operations? 
       </div>
        <div class="accordion-item-body">
          <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
            Yes. If an employer's workplace is closed by a governmental order for certain purposes, but the employer's workplace may remain open for other purposes or the employer is able to continue certain operations remotely, the employer's operations would be considered to be partially suspended. However, if all of an employer's business operations may continue, even if subject to modification (for example, to satisfy distancing requirements), such a modification of operations is not considered to be a partial suspension of business operations due to a governmental order, unless the modification required by the governmental order has more than a nominal effect on the business operations under the facts and circumstances.

          10. Are an employer's operations considered to be partially suspended for purposes of the Employee Retention Credit if the employer is required to reduce its operating hours by a governmental order?
      </div>
        <div class="accordion-item-body">
          <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
            Yes. An employer that reduces its operating hours due to a governmental order is considered to have partially suspended its operations since the employer's operations have been limited by a governmental order.
            <br>
         The employer may also be an Eligible Employer if it experiences a significant decline in gross receipts.

            11. If an employer is subject to a governmental order to fully or partially suspend its business operations and the order is subsequently lifted, is the employer considered to have business operations that were suspended?

          <div class="accordion-item-body">
            <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
              Yes, but only for periods during the calendar quarters in which the trade or business operations were fully or partially suspended. If the order was effective for a portion of the calendar quarter, then the employer is an Eligible Employer for the entire calendar quarter but can only claim a credit for wages paid during the period the order is in force.
